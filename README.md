# Self-Healing Material Simulation  

A **numerical simulation** for modeling self-healing materials using diffusion, reaction kinetics and stress distribution analysis.  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project simulates the healing process of materials by modeling **diffusion, adsorption, and stress dynamics** in a 1D domain. The system evaluates **crack closure efficiency** based on **concentration dynamics** and **stress distribution** over time.  

## Features  
- **Diffusion-reaction modeling** of healing agents.  
- **Stress analysis** based on material elasticity.  
- **Crack closure detection** based on concentration and stress thresholds.  
- **Sensitivity analysis** for diffusion coefficient, reaction rate, and temperature effects.
